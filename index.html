          Para una empresa de la envergadura de una fábrica como Fibrargent, se recomienda un presupuesto dividido en

          <li class="mb-4"><strong>Recomendación de mercado:</strong> Dado el nivel de servicios (Full-stack + Marketing
            + Diseño),
            el abono debería situarse en un rango competitivo que refleje la especialización B2B.</li>
          <li class="mb-4"><strong>Forma de pago:</strong> la correspondiente según condición fiscal, del 1 al 5 de cada
